# odinLandingPage

Project for Odin Project's landing page assignment.
Used Grok for the cat images and general content as I'm not experienced with lawyer speak.
Also had it help me with getting a bit more responsiveness with the media query.
Learned a good bit from all of this compared to some of the projects I'd done on freecodecamp.
Definitely getting more comfortable starting a design from scratch and working with flexbox.
